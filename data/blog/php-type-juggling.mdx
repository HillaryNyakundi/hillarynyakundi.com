PHP supports two common ways of comparing variables. One way is through `loose comparison` (== or !=) and the other is through `strict comparison` (=== or !==). Loose comparison checks whether both variables have “the same value” while strict comparison confirms if both variables have “the same type and value”. PHP type juggling vulnerabilities arise when loose comparison is employed instead of strict comparison in an area where the attacker can control one of the variables being compared.

## Illustration

When PHP needs to compare a string with an integer, PHP will attempt to extract the integer from the string. So a comparison like `‘2 books’ == 2` will evaluate to `True`. If the string that is being compared does not contain an integer, then string will then be converted to a “0” hence `‘books’ == 0` will evaluate to `True`.

```PHP
if('2 books' == 2){echo "True"; } else {echo "False";}
True

if('1234' == '1234'){echo "True"; } else {echo "False";}
True

if('1234' == 1234){echo "True"; } else {echo "False";}
True

if('abc' == 0) {echo "True"; } else {echo "False";}
True

if('xyz' == true) {echo "True"; } else {echo "False";}
True

if('xyz' == 'true') {echo "True"; } else {echo "False";}
False

if('books' == 0){echo "True"; }  else {echo "False";}
True
```

## Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

Loose type comparison behavior in PHP can be exploited to allow authentication bypass. In the following below code snippet, submitting an integer input `0` or boolean input `true` will successfully authenticate you as an administrator.

```PHP:auth.php
if($_POST["password"] == "Admin_Password") {
go_to_admin_dashboard();
}
```

I have created a trivial challenge here:- https://php-type-juggling.herokuapp.com/

Try bypass authentication to retrieve the JWT auth token and flag.

## Remediation

PHP type juggling vulnerabilities can be avoided by making use strict comparison using three equals symbols (===) instead of two (==). This also applies for !=, which should be avoided in favor of !==. This makes sure that the type is taken into consideration when comparing the values.
